# Time-Series-Forecasting
### Forecasting Items Sold Using Basic Time Series Model, ANN and Prophet Model
In this notebook, we will attempt to predict the quantity of products sold by a company from January 2022 to March 2023. We will compare several models, including basic time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing, as well as an ANN model and the Prophet algorithm. The objective of this notebook is to determine the most accurate model and use it to predict the quantity of items sold for several weeks in advance

Data field description:
- week_number: contained information about week of specific product sold, (2021-52 to 2023-14).
- week_start_date: contained information about week start date of specific product sold.
- week_end_date: contained information about week end date of specific product sold.
